Why Heralune?
This project came about because I needed a safe, easy-to-use, and private place to think during emotionally hard times.
It is built on empathy and uses ethical AI to help people think, not judge.

Development Notes & Transparency
This project is a step in my journey to learn AI on my own.
I made changes to the UI, added core integrations, and added specific Heralune features. I also reused small pieces of open-source Flask code to speed up development.
ChatGPT helped with debugging.
All of the reused code was looked over, changed, and combined with the original work to meet the app's needs.
